*Earthquake in which the rupture propagation speeds are greater than the shear wave speed*  
Source (Wikipedia): [Supershear earthquake][1]

In seismology, a supershear earthquake is an earthquake in which the propagation of the rupture along the fault surface occurs at speeds in excess of the seismic shear wave (S-wave) velocity. This causes an effect analogous to a sonic boom.
