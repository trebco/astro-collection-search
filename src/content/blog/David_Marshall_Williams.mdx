*American murderer and firearms designer*  
Source (Wikipedia): [David Marshall Williams][1]

David Marshall Williams was an American firearms designer and convicted murderer who invented the floating chamber and the short-stroke gas piston. Both designs used the high-pressure gas generated in or near the breech of the firearm to operate the action of semi-automatic firearms like the M1 Carbine.
