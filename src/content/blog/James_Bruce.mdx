James Bruce of Kinnaird was a Scottish traveller and travel writer who confirmed the source of the Blue Nile. He spent more than a dozen years in North Africa and Ethiopia and in 1770 became the second European to trace the origins of the Blue Nile from Egypt and Sudan, after the Spanish Pedro Paez.
