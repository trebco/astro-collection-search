All Nippon Airways Flight 533, registration JA8658, was a NAMC YS-11 en route from Osaka, Japan, to Matsuyama on the island of Shikoku. It was the fifth crash in Japan in 1966 and the second one experienced by All Nippon Airways that year, the first being the loss of Flight 60 on February 4. It was also, at the time, the deadliest crash of an NAMC YS-11, and remains the second-deadliest after Toa Domestic Airlines Flight 63, which crashed in 1971 with 68 deaths.
