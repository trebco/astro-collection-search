*French astronomer (1824–1907)*  
Source (Wikipedia): [Pierre Janssen][1]

Pierre Jules César Janssen, usually known as Jules Janssen, was a French astronomer who, along with English scientist Joseph Norman Lockyer, is credited with discovering the gaseous nature of the solar chromosphere, but there is no justification for the conclusion that he deserves credit for the co-discovery of the element helium.
