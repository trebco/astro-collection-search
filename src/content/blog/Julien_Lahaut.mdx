Source (Wikipedia): [Julien Lahaut][1]

Julien-Victor Lahaut was a Belgian politician and communist activist was president of the Communist Party of Belgium from 1945 to 1950. An important figure during the German occupation of 1940–44, he became a vocal advocate for the abolition of the Belgian monarchy during the post-war Royal Question. His assassination in August 1950, at the height of the crisis, has often been attributed to Belgian royalists but remains officially unsolved.
