*Bolognese painter of the Baroque (1555–1619)*  
Source (Wikipedia): [Ludovico Carracci][1]

Ludovico Carracci was an Italian, early-Baroque painter, etcher, and printmaker born in Bologna. His works are characterized by a strong mood invoked by broad gestures and flickering light that create spiritual emotion and are credited with reinvigorating Italian art, especially fresco art, which was subsumed with formalistic Mannerism. He died in Bologna in 1619.
