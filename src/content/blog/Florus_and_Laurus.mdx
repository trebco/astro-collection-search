*Christian martyrs*  
Source (Wikipedia): [Florus and Laurus][1]

Saints Florus and Laurus are venerated as Christian martyrs of the 2nd century. According to a Greek tale, they were twin brothers who worked as stonemasons. They were originally from Byzantium but settled in Ulpiana, Dardania, south of modern Pristina, Kosovo in the district of Illyricum. They were educated in the art of masonry by two men named Maximus and Proculus, who were Christians.
