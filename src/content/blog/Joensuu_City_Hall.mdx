Source (Wikipedia): [Joensuu City Hall][1]

The Joensuu City Hall is a brick building in the center of Joensuu, Finland, designed by Eliel Saarinen and completed in 1914, combining styles of Romantic Nationalism and late Art Nouveau. It serves as a center of culture and governance for the city. It houses the city's central administration, the city theater and a restaurant. The city hall is located on the banks of the Pielinen River on the Rantakatu street. After its completion on November 14, 1914, the new city hall corresponded quite closely to Saarinen's drawings, especially from its facades. The facade statues were designed by sculptor Johannes Haapasalo.
