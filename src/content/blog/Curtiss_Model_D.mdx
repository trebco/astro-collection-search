Source (Wikipedia): [Curtiss Model D][1]

The 1911 Curtiss Model D is an early United States pusher aircraft with the engine and propeller behind the pilot's seat. It was among the first aircraft in the world to be built in any quantity, during an era of trial-and-error development and equally important parallel technical development in internal combustion engine technologies.
