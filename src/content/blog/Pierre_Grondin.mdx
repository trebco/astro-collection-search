Pierre Grondin was a Canadian cardiac surgeon who was one of the first doctors to perform a successful heart transplant. He brought many innovations to the Montreal Heart Institute after his post-graduate training with pioneers Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley in Houston, Texas. He was one of a select few heart surgeons worldwide who participated in the development of open-heart surgery using the heart-lung machine in the early 1950s. He performed the first successful heart transplantation in Canada at the Montreal Heart Institute in May 1968.
