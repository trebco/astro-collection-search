*German physician (1715–1762)*  
Source (Wikipedia): [Dorothea Erxleben][1]

Dorothea Christiane Erxleben was a German medical doctor who became the first female doctor of medicine in Germany. Educated by her progressive physician father and rector of her school, she desired to attend medical school and study medicine like her brother. She eventually petitioned Frederick the Great of Prussia to allow her entry into the University of Halle. Despite a Royal permission to attend, Erxleben never entered University. When her cousin died, leaving five children, she decided in 1741, at the age of 26, to look after them, married widower Johann Christian Erxleben and went on to have four children with him.
