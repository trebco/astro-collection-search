Source (Wikipedia): [Cecilie Thoresen Krog][1]

Ida Cecilie Thoresen Krog was a Norwegian women's rights pioneer and Liberal Party politician, and the first female university student in Norway. She became famous when she was allowed to submit to examen artium in 1882, after an Act amendment had taken place. She was the first president of the women's rights association Skuld and a co-founder and vice president of its successor, the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. She was also a co-founder and board member of the Norwegian Women's Public Health Association. She was active in the Liberal Party and her liberal views also colored her involvement in the women's rights movement. She was elected a deputy representative in Christiania City Council for the Liberal Party in 1901, as one of the first women elected to a political office in Norway.
