Source (Wikipedia): [Jan Zach][1]

Jan Zach, called in German Johann Zach was a Czech composer, violinist and organist. Although he was a gifted and versatile composer capable of writing both in Baroque and Classical idioms, his eccentric personality led to numerous conflicts and lack of steady employment from about 1756 onwards.
